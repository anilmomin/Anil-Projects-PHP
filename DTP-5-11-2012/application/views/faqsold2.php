              <li>
                <p class="que">If I purchase an advertised deal, how long will it take for me to receive my order?</p>
                <p class="ans">The quick answer is within 2 weeks. The longer answer is determined by multiple factors such as, but not limited to, the proximity of the nominated delivery address to the location of the supplying winery, the date of order and the popularity of the order. For more details, please refer to the full Terms and Conditions available from the Terms and Conditions link within this site.</p>

              <li>
                <p class="que">If I register to receive a sample, will I be guaranteed of receiving a sample?</p>
                <p class="ans">No. We cannot guarantee that everyone that registers receives a sample. There are certain eligibility criteria that one needs to fill to be considered to receive a sample, such as being at least 18 years old and residing in Australia. Other eligibility criteria may be found  in the Terms and Conditions section of the site.</p>                
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <p class="que">Are my sample registration details automatically returned to the list of willing sample recipients once I have received a sample?</p>
                <p class="ans">No. Once you have received a sample for evaluation and once you have provided your feedback on a given sample, we do not assume that you are interested in participating in another evaluation. Once you have provided your feedback for a particular sample, you are eligible to re-register as a sample recipient but such a re-registration is not automatic.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <p class="que">Can I nominate more than one wine style preference during the registration process?</p>
                <p class="ans">Yes. If you nominate that you have multiple preferred wine styles, your registration will be added to multiple wine preference lists for sample receipt. However, as soon as we send you a sample of one of your nominated preferred wine styles, your details will be removed from all sample receipt preference lists. Once you have provided feedback on the received sample, you will become eligible to re-register to receive another sample.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="que">Can I purchase the same deal from the Supplying Winery without going through Ditch the Pitch?</p>
                <p class="ans">Yes, but it will cost you more if you do so, at least during the promotional period! One of the benefits of a Supply Winery selling wine through Ditch the Pitch is that they can measure the success of the exercise. To encourage a measurable success, the Supplying Winery advertises a deal unique to Ditch the Pitch for a promotional period. </p>

              <li>
                <p class="que">How long do I have to wait from registration to sample receipt?</p>
                <p class="ans">There are many variables that determine the answer to this question. Factors include your nominated wine preference, the number of people on your preferred wine style receipt list and how many Supplying Wineries are lined up ready to provide samples of your preferred wine style(s).</p>
              </li>
              
            <li>
              <p class="que">Can I make multiple registrations to receive multiple samples?</p>
              <p class="ans">Yes, but it will not mean that you will receive multiple samples. The administrators of Ditch the Pitch will review the received data to ensure that the spread of samples is as fair as possible. Additionally, the site has some processes in place to identify duplicated data. </p>

            <li>
              <p class="que">Is wine purchased through Ditch the Pitch genuinely winery direct?</p>
              <p class="ans">Yes. Orders received by the Supplying Winery are sent directly from the Supplying Winery to the purchasers nominated delivery address. There is no double handling.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="que">Does a winery participating in the sample process have to make an offer? </p>
              <p class="ans">No. A winery may have a wine evaluated through the Ditch the Pitch sample evaluation process and choose not to advertise a subsequent deal.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="que">Can I purchase wines from multiple advertised deals in one transaction?</p>

            <li>
              <p class="que">It has been some time since I have registered but I am yet to receive a sample for evaluation? Is there something wrong?</p>
              <p class="ans">No. As long as you remain an eligible sample recipient you will remain on the list to receive a sample. Even if the period since registering has been many months, so long as you remain eligible, you will be making your way to the top of the list of those to receive a sample.</p>

              <p class="que">Can I purchase more than one of the same advertised deal in one transaction?</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="que">Can I make up a mixed dozen from various advertised wine deals? </p>
              <p class="ans">No. It is not possible to change the mix within any advertised offer or across any advertised offers.</p>
            </li>

              <p class="que">Can I receive more than one sample for evaluation?</p>

            <li>
              <p class="que">Are there factors that may prevent me from being eligible to receive a sample?</p>

              <p class="que">Do I have to provide feedback for a received sample?</p>
              <p class="ans">It is essential that you do. The sustainability of Ditch the Pitch will be determined by how much a winery benefits from participating in the process. The sample feedback is the most important benefit for Supplying Wineries.</p>
