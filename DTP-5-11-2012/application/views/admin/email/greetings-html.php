<p>Thank you for registering as an eligible wine tasting participant with Ditch the Pitch.</p>

<p>We confirm that you have nominated <b><?php echo $emaildata->preference; ?></b> as your preferred wine style.

We will attempt to send you a sample of a wine that best matches your nominated preference as soon as we can. If a sample similar to your nominated preference does not arise soon enough or if you have nominated a wine style that has been requested by thousands of others, we may end up choosing to send you a wine sample that resembles some of your other stated wine preferences.</p>

<p>In any event, due to the popularity of this site, and the limited number of wines that we can practically distribute, we ask that you be patient.

In the meantime, we hope that you enjoy the site and participate in some of the great deals posted.

If you have any queries at any time, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>
Best wishes,</p>
<p>
The Ditch the Pitch team.
