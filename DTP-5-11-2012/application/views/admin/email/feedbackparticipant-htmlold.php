<p>Congratulations! By submitting your wine value feedback within the allotted timeframe, you have given yourself a chance to wine a free dozen of the wine being assessed.
Also, if you nominate the value is closest to the average value give to the wine being assessed by your group of fellow tasters, you will be eligible to be in the running to be awarded ‘Ditch the Pitch Wine Taster of the Year’.</p>
<p>We hope that you have enjoyed the process.
By completing the process, you may now elect to participate in a future wine evaluation.

<p>We now encourage you to monitor www.ditchthepitch.com.au to find out if the winemaker listened to your feedback! If you like the wine and the offer, we encourage you to get together with your family and friends to buy some of the wine.
