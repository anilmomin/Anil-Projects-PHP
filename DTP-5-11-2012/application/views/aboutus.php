<p> <b>Had enough of the various sales 'pitches' associated with wine promotions? </b> </p>
<p>According to Wikipedia: </p>
<p>"In selling technique, a sales pitch is a line of talk that attempts to persuade someone or something, with a planned sales presentation strategy of a product or a service designed to initiate and close a sale of the particular product or service."  </p>
<p>We have one thing to say … </p>

<p>We say, at least for the promotion of wine sales … it's time to ditch the pitch. </p>

<p>But more importantly, we want you to have a say …					</p>				

<p>Wine used to be a commodity that was priced according to customer opinion. </p>

<p>Ditch the Pitch provides you with the forum to have a say!</p>

<p>Ditch the Pitch is a win/win formula.</p>

<p>Wine customers win. Consumers 	</p>

<ul>

<li>	may openly express their view on a wine or a wine promotion </li>
<li>	may influence the sale price of a wine </li>
<li>	are introduced to wines/brands/regions that may have otherwise been unfamiliar</li>
<li>	are given the opportunity to benchmark their palate to the palate of other consumers and ultimately to the winemaker</li>
<li>	are given the opportunity to communicate directly with the wine producer</li>
<li>	have the opportunity to purchase wines at a 'fair' price</li>
<li>	have the opportunity to win prizes</li>
<li>	have the opportunity to be awarded consumer wine assessment awards  </li>


</ul>												

<p> <p class="fwb" style="font-weight:bold;"> Why Ditch the Pitch? Have you ever heard?</p>
<ul>
<li> Recommended retail prices that have never been realized but are happily quoted in advertising to justify an amazingly high discount percentage? </li>
<li>Free freight on purchases made this weekend only?</li>
<li> Incentives to recommend a friend?</li>
<li> Sign up today for $ XX credit?</li>
<li> Buy today and receive a free cookbook or calendar or XX?</li>
<li> A well groomed, IT savvy business person promoting their 'special cellar door direct to you' sale opportunity from their capital city CBD office?</li>
<li> The value of a gold medal awarded in class 148 at a wine show in a location that is difficult to find in Google Earth?</li>
</ul>

<p> Ditch the Pitch empowers wine consumers. </p>

<p> 'Ditch the Pitch' is a site where wine consumers embrace the opportunity to express their views on the value of a particular wine. The wine value opinions are presented for consideration by the winemaker who is then given the opportunity to present a genuine wine buying opportunity through this site, directly from the winery to the consumer, whereby any pitch has been ditched! </p>

<p> 'Ditch the Pitch' is also a site where wine consumers are encouraged to comment on a particular wine promotion. </p>

<p> It is a site where advertising pitches are questioned and tested, where some new wine jewels are uncovered, where consumers are introduced to winemakers … where consumers are given the opportunity to be heard.  </p>
