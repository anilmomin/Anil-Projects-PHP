            <strong>Why the need for such a site?</strong>
            <p>The success of sales through this site will ultimately determine if there is indeed a need for this site. Ditch the Pitch was created by a winemaker. There were multiple reasons to initiate this site.  </p>

                      <p>The above motivations to start this site are consumer or consumer/winemaker benefits. The final motivation to get this site up and running was to create sales. The winemaker behind the site will be offering some of his products for sale through this site but it is also the intention of the site to offer wines from many lesser known wineries/winemakers with a sales outcome in mind.</p>
                      <p>When undertaking Cellar Door duties, he was often asked by customers; </p>
                      <p>what is the true recommended retail price of a wine? Or,<br />
                        what is the value of a wine show medal? </p>
                      <p>He was also tied of reading and hearing of the various sales claims being made by people promoting wine sales. Sure, under competitive market conditions there is a need to be extra creative but there needs to be a minimum level of integrity within creativity.</p>
                      <p>And everyone deserves a chance but as a long term industry player, he was more used to wine consumers ultimately determining the value of a wine. </p>

                      <p>In the 1980’s, if a new wine producer realesed a wine at a given price, the price would ultimately be adjusted by consumers. If the wine was value, the wine would sell out quickly. This would give the producer the opportunity to slightly increase the price of the next vintage release and so on. However, if consumers believe that the initial release was overpriced, the customer value determination would mean that sales would be unsatisfactory and the subsequent vintage release may be priced at a slightly lower than the initial release. In the over valued release example, even if the first vintage sold out quickly, sales of the second release may have been slow due to customer …</p>
                      <p>It is time to hand the power of wine values back to consumers!<br />
                          <br />
                        As a producer, he believed that he had a network of colleagues that would be willing to support the idea of empowering the consumers to influence a wine value. No big claims, no pitch! </p>
                      <p>The network of winemakers was seen as important to present <br /></p>
