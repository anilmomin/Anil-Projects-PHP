<br />

<br />
<br />


<p>When viewing an advertised deal, Ditch the Pitch should be considered as fulfilling the role played by any regular advertiser. Ditch the Pitch is not the seller of the wine and therefore the terms and conditions that apply to matters such as delivery timeframes, delivery problems, quality issues and the like, are according to the terms and conditions of the Supplying Winery. Please read the terms and conditions relating to conditions of sale available from the website of supplying winery prior to ordering any advertised offer, or if not available at the Supplying Winery website, please contact the Supplying Winery directly for details.  </p>

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />


<ol type="a">

</ul>
<br />
<br />
<strong class="redhdng">4. Sample Registration.</strong>
<br/>
<br />
<p> Multiple sample receipt registrations do not increase your chance of being sent a sample. If you register more than once as a party interested in receiving a sample you will void all of your registrations. Therefore, if you wish to be considered for being sent a sample to be evaluated, do not make multiple sample registrations. If you are genuine about your willingness to participate in the sample evaluation process, do not register to receive a sample more than once. Each registration is linked to a user name and an email address. Sample registration lists are screened to identify multiple registrations from an individual user. </p>
<br />
<br />


<p> It is very important to be aware that by registering to receive a sample you are not guaranteed that you will receive a sample.   </p>
<br />
<br />

<p> There are some fundamental requirements that need to be fulfilled to be considered eligible to receive a sample. All persons registering to receive a sample will need to satisfy the eligibility criteria.  </p>

<br />
<br />

<p> The administrators of Ditch the Pitch have the authority to determine who receives a sample for evaluation and who does not. Similarly, the administrators of Ditch the Pitch have the authority to determine who receives what particular wine sample.   </p>
<br />
<br />

<p>By registering to receive a sample, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of sample distribution </p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Wine sample supply will influenced by the amount of interest from Supplying Wineries. The more benefits a Supplying Winery consider achievable from participation in the Ditch the Pitch process, the more likely a sample supply stream will be sustained. If feedback from samples is not meaningful and/or if the process does not financially benefit the Supplying Winery, the less likely it is that samples will remain available for supply. Therefore, sample supply will be influenced by the amount of quality feedback and sales achieved by the Supplying Winery as a result of participating in the process.</p>
<strong class="redhdng">5. Sample registration process</strong>
<br />
<br />
<p>Click on any of the ‘register for sample’ tabs highlighted on the website if you wish to be considered for receiving a wine sample for evaluation and complete the registration process. </p>
<br />
<br />
<p>To be considered for a sample receipt, it is necessary to satisfy the eligibility criteria of being 18 years of age or older and being a resident of Australia.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>During the registration process, you will be asked to indicate your wine preference. </p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Please complete the sample receipt registration process accurately. Ensure that you have completed all mandatory boxes accurately. If your email address is incorrect, you will not receive a sample for evaluation. If you fail to nominate a preferred wine style, you may never receive a sample. Therefore, take care when registering. </p>
<br />
<br />
<p>If you are deemed eligible to receive a sample, your registration makes it to the top of the sample distribution list and a wine of your preferred style is available for evaluation, you will be contacted by Ditch the Pitch to confirm your willingness to receive a sample and to obtain your nominated sampled delivery address.</p>
<br />
<br />
<strong class="redhdng">6. Evaluation Feedback</strong>
<br/>
<br />

<p>By agreeing to receive a wine sample for evaluation, you are agreeing to provide your feedback on the sampled wine within a defined timeframe. You are also agreeing to the manner in which the feedback is to be supplied.</p>
<br />
<br />

<p>Failure to provide feedback within the agreed timeframes and through the designated format will result in permanent sample distribution ineligibility. </p>
<br />
<br />

<p>To provide feedback on a received sample; click on a ’Valuation Feedback’ tab within the website, then enter your repsonses.</p>

<br />
<br />
<strong class="redhdng">7. Repeat sample receipt</strong>
<br/>
<br />
<p>If you are awarded recognition as having a representative palate according the Ditch the Pitch consumer Award system, you may be deemed eligible to receive another wine for evaluation. </p>
<br />
<br />

<strong class="redhdng">8. Wine Evaluation Report and sharing of contact details with the Supplying Winery </strong>
<br />
<br />
<p>One of the benefits that a sample Supplying Winery obtains from participating in the Ditch the Pitch process is a report containing all the feedback received by Ditch the Pitch for a given wine. The Evaluation Report is also something tangible and accountable. Although the Evaluation Report features a summary of results, it also contains all unedited comments and feedback. Included in the Evaluation Report is a list of those who received a sample, and their associated contact details. By agreeing to participate in the evaluation process, you are consenting for your contact details to be shared with the winery supplying the sample. Your supplied details then become subject to the privacy policy terms and conditions of the Supplying Winery providing the sample. </p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Similarly, when ordering a wine advertised through Ditch the Pitch, your order is placed with the Supplying Winery. By placing an order you are aware that your order details are provided to the Supplying Winery. Your supplied details then become subject to the privacy policing terms and conditions of the Supplying Winery providing the sample.</p>
<br />
<br />
<strong class="redhdng">9. Delivery of Samples</strong>
<br />
<br />
<p>Sample delivery will be co-ordinated and undertaken by Ditch the Pitch. Wines for sample distribution are sent to Ditch the Pitch for packing into single bottle packs, addressing and loading in to the Australia Post e-parcel system. E-parcel allows for tracking of items once entered into their delivery system. Samples will be addressed according to the email exchanges that occur between registrants and Ditch the Pitch following the sample registration process. Samples are delivered according to the terms and conditions of Australia Post. Ditch the Pitch has no influence or control over the production techniques or quality of wines supplied for the sample evaluation process and therefore accepts no responsibility or liability in any way or form for the quality or condition of sample wine distributed. </p>
<br />
<br />
<strong class="redhdng">10. Delivery of ordered wine</strong>
<br />
<br />
<p>The distribution of wines ordered from deals advertised on Ditch the Pitch is genuinely winery direct. Therefore, the method of delivery, the courier used and the terms and conditions of supply will be according to the standard supply Terms and Conditions of the Supplying Winery. Ditch the Pitch has no influence or control over how a Supplying Winery processes and delivers a wine order, nor does Ditch the Pitch have influence or control over the production techniques or quality of wines supplied in any given order and therefore accepts no responsibility or liability in any way or form for the quality, timing or condition of wine ordered from an advertised deal on Ditch the Pitch.</p>
<br />
<br />

<p>Should there be a problem with a delivery relating to an order, please make direct contact with the Supplying Winery. Do not contact Ditch the Pitch to query the quality, timing or condition of wine ordered through Ditch the Pitch. However, if you are unable to resolve a problem with a Supplying Winery, Ditch the Pitch, without responsibility of liability, will be more than pleased to learn of your circumstances to determine if assistance may be offered to resolve the problem. <p>
<br />
<br />
<p>There are several factors that may delay the delivery of an ordered wine. Some factors that may result in a delayed delivery are, but are not limited to:</p>
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li> a. Payment. A wine order despatch may be delayed by the Supplying Winery if there is a problem with the order payment, such as a declined credit card or insufficient funds in a PayPal account.</li>
<li>b. Geographical. The proximity of the nominated delivery address to a Supplying Winery will impact on the delivery time. The greater the distance between the winery location and the delivery address, the greater the delivery time.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />
<p>As a rule of thumb, please allow two weeks from order placement to delivery prior to expressing delivery delay concerns with the Supplying Winery.</p>
<br />
<br />
<strong class="redhdng">11. Payment</strong>
