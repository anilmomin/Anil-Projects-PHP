              <h4>1. Registration:</h4>
              <p>If you choose to register, you will be asked to complete some simple questions, including verification that you are 18 years of age or older through entering your date of birth. A sample of the registration form that you will be asked to complete on line is available <a href="<?=site_url('sampleregistration/registrationform/1');?>">Sample Registration Form.</a></p>
              <p>The purpose of the questions asked during registration is to ensure that;  you reside in Australia,  we have accurate records of your contact details, and  we know your wine style preferences. </p>
              <p>Why do we need to know your wine style preferences? We are only interested in gathering relevant feedback. We are not too concerned about your level of wine tasting experience to participate but we are concerned that we send you a wine style that is non-preferred. Put another way, we do not want to send a Chardonnay to a non-Chardonnay drinker, nor would we want to send a Moscato to someone who only drinks dry wine and, similarly, we do not want the send a Shiraz to someone who only enjoys white wine. </p>
              <p>You will not be asked for your ‘wine sample’ delivery address during registration. You will be asked for this when you are contacted during the sample acceptance confirmation stage. Please refer to point 3 below. An indication of what you will be asked during the registration process is available <a href="<?=site_url('sampleregistration/democlaimform');?>">Sample On-line Registration Form.</a></p>
    
               <h4> 2. Eligibility:  </h4>
              <p>As stated above, to be eligible to receive a bottle of wine for evaluation, you must be 18 years of age or older and you must reside in Australia. If you do not qualify on both of the conditions, you will not be sent a sample bottle. Furthermore, to be able to complete the registration process, you must reside within areas of Australia where it is legal to receive and consume alcohol.</p>

              <h4>3. Samples: </h4>
              <p>If you are eligible and if your name is included in the next group of sample recipients, we will send you an email. We will email you to confirm that you are willing to receive a wine sample and that you are willing to participate in the valuation exercise according to the terms and conditions of the valuation. A sample of the email we will send at this stage of the process is available for viewing <a href="#email" rel="facebox">Sample Participation Email.</a> If you positively confirm both of these questions, you will be asked to provide your postal address details for us to send you the sample for review. </p>
              <h4>4. Timeframe: </h4>
              <p>It is important that people agreeing to receive samples honour their commitment to providing their value feedback within the agreed timeframe. The winery purchase opportunity for a given wine is posted on the Ditch the Pitch website 30 days after sample dispatch date. </p>
              <h4>5. Feedback: </h4>
              <p>Wine value feedback is required through the Ditch the Pitch website. A sample of the feedback form that you will be asked to complete on line is available <a href="<?php echo site_url('feedback/demopage'); ?>">Sample Feedback Form</a>. The key feedback information that we seek is your answer to the question … How much money would you be prepared to pay per bottle of the wine that you have evaluated if you were to purchase 1 dozen bottles and have them delivered to you via Australia Post?         The feedback form contains other questions that you may choose to answer. Further feedback is possible through the on-line discussion facility within the site.</p>

              <h4>6. Report: </h4>
              <p>The feedback of a given wine is collated, analysed and presented to the winemaker in a report form. Upon receiving the report, and depending on the consumer valuation of a wine, the winemaker will choose to, or not to, present a public offer of the wine that was evaluated through the Ditch the Pitch website. The report is considered important market feedback to the producer. However, presenting an attractive wine purchase opportunity that is well supported will assist the winemaker in attaining a return on the overall investment in the Ditch the Pitch process. </p>
              <h4>7. Offer: </h4>
              <p>Should the winemaker choose to post an offer through the Ditch the Pitch website, it will generally be done for a designated quantity for a maximum period of time. The offer posted by the winemaker will be exclusive to Ditch the Pitch. The winemaker undertakes not to make the wine available at a lower price through any other medium for a minimum period. Therefore, not only do Ditch the Pitch consumers influence the wine selling price to ensure value, they also have access to exclusive wine buying opportunities. To minimize handling costs, wines purchased through Ditch the Pitch will actually be winery direct transaction with the wine being supplied directly from the winery to the purchaser. </p>
